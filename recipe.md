  Preheat oven to 300°F (148°C) and prepare a cupcake pan with liners.

  Combine the egg, Butter milk, Vegetable oil & vanilla in another medium sized bowl.
  Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients & mix until well combined.
  Add the water to the batter & mix until well combined.Batter will be thin.
  Fill the cupcake liners about half way and bake for 18-23 mins, or until a tooth pick comes out with a few 
  moist crumbs.
  Remove the cupcakes from oven & allow to cool for 2 mins, Then remove to a Coolin rack to finish Cooling.
  To make the frosting, beat the butter in a large mixer bowl and mix until smooth.
  Add the melted chocolate and mix until well combined.
  Add the cocoa powder and mix until well combined.
  Add about half of powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of heavy cream and mix until well combined.
  Add remaining powdered sugar and salt and mix until smooth.
  Add remaining heavy cream as needed to get the right consistency of frosting.
  Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes.

  *You can also use regular unsweetened cocoa powder instead of Hershey’s Special Dark Cocoa powder.

   NOTE : This recipe calls for hot water. You don’t have to use hot water – the cake will still bake fine –
   but the hot water allows the cocoa to “bloom”, which brings out a richer chocolate flavor in the cake.
